\begin{abstract}
    Recent years have witnessed a surge in Computer Science (CS) research, which achieved unparalleled
    successes in a kaleidoscope of science and engineering applications spanning
    artificial intelligence \cite{Silver:2016:Go}, natural language processing \cite{Manning:2014:NLP}, computer vision \cite{Alex:2012:AlexNet},
    statistical learning theory \cite{LeCun:2015:DL}, blockchain and cryptocurrency \cite{Bonneau:2015:SOK},
    computational biology \cite{Cock:2009:BioPy} and bioinformatics \cite{Saeys:2007:Bio},
    intelligent grids and Internet-of-Things (IoT) \cite{Atzori:2010:IOT}. Consequently,
    the difficulty of pursuing a higher degree in CS or related subjects in decent graduate
    schools has been elevated to an unprecedented new height \cite{Rag:2010:GRAD}. In this paper, motivated
    by these observations, the authors, consisting of a data-driven earth scientist, a computational biologist,
     and a machine learning researcher, study the factors governing the
    admissions of graduate schools in the U.S. by means of general linear
    models (GLM) and general additive models (GAM). We seek answers to several interesting questions and
    render crisp insights from the model inference and analysis.
    We conclude this paper by providing guidelines for future graduate schools
    applicants, identifying limitations that are not addressed by this paper
    and pointing out several possible future directions.

\section{Introduction}

\note{To be further extended.}

Through the study outlined in this paper, we aim at seeking a better understanding of graduate school applications in CS related subjects. We summarize our contribution as follows:

\begin{itemize}
    \item We give a systematic study of the data available on \noun{GradCafe} \cite{GradCafe}.
	To the best of our knowledge, this is the first work achieving this.

    \item We give quantitative results of the answers to the following curious and important
	questions:
	    \begin{enumerate}
		\item \emph{What are the significant covariates that impact the application results?}

		\item \emph{Do GPA and standard test scores affects the application results differently for MS
		    and PhD applicants?}

		\item \emph{Does possessing a U.S. Bachelor degree significantly increases the likelihood of being admitted?}
	    \end{enumerate}

    \item We give guidelines and insights drawn from our analysis to prospective applicants.

\end{itemize}

This paper is structured as follows, \Cref{sec:background} introduces
the dataset protocol and recall important notions of GLM and GAM, which
we only give a brief treatment as the readers of this paper are expected
to be familiar with these topics; \Cref{sec:methods} discusses the models
we adopt for the admission results data, we emphasis on the applicability
and estimate the expressivity of the model chosen; we next fit the proposed
model in \Cref{sec:results} together with model selection and parameter analysis
and interpretation, based on which, we are ready to outline the answers to the
questions of interest as well as provide tips in \Cref{sec:conclusions}. We also
include a sketchy mention of the limitations and future directions as we
conclude this paper.

	\end{table}
	In this paper, we collect data from \noun{GradCafe} \cite{GradCafe}, an online
	sharing platform of graduate school admission results. The dataset
	involves the following covariates:
	\var{university}, the graduate school the applicant applied for;
	\var{degree}, one of either \var{\{MBA, MEng, MFA, MS, PhD, Other\}}, the desired degree applied for;
	\var{decision}, one of either \var{\{Accepted, Rejected, Wait Listed\}}, the application result;
	\var{gpa}, the latest Grading Point Average (GPA) the applicant possesses;
	\var{gre\_verbal}, \var{gre\_quant}, \var{gre\_writing}, standard test scores examining verbal, quantitative and writing skills;
	\var{status}, either one of \var{\{American, International, International with US Degree,
	Other\}}, dictating the status of the applicant as of the application
	\var{comments}, additional information shared by the applicant. Several
	typical entries are tabulated in \Cref{table:data_sample}.

	We augment this dataset by introducing metrics examining the prestigious of the graduate
	school. Instead of selecting from a variety of university ranking, we focus on the \noun{CSRanking} \cite{CSR},
	which is specifically tailored for CS research. To that end, we attach two more covariates per record,
	namely,
	\var{publications}, publication index, the multiplier of number of total publications with reference
	to the lowest value;
	\var{faculty}, the number of faculty members (not counting Emeritus faculties).
	We note through our data exploration, these metrics, though may seem partial at first mention,
	are consistent with the general college ranking results such as
	the US News and Times.

	We preprocess the dataset to select those applications made to US universities,
	clean up invalid data, normalize the GPA on a $4.0$ scale and GRE tests
	to new scale ($170$ maximum). We also merge the categories \var{\{MBA, MEng, MFA, MS, Other\}}
	to a singleton \var{MS} as it suffices the objectives set for this paper. After these manipulations,
	we had $21209$ records from the applications ranging from $2011$ to $2015$. Noted some records
	may miss certain metrics such as GPA, in that case, our model ignore the very entries for parameter
	estimation. A short summary of the cleaned dataset is given in \Cref{table:data_summary:quant,table:data_summary:cat}. We also plot the histogram of several selected covariates in \Cref{fig:dataset}.

\section{Conclusions and Future Directions} \label{sec:conclusions}

    In this paper, we study the factors that are significant
    to the applications for CS graduate programs in the U.S.
    And empirically tested out several prevailed intuitions, namely,
    the U.S. bachelor degree is favourable, especially in PhD applications.

    We also noted several intrinsic defficiencies of the model, for example,
    the representativeness of the data collected. Namely,
    the data collected may be not a representative sample
    from the unknown population: the data may be more correlated
    as intuitively, most failed applicants may wish not to share
    this experience online. Furthermore, more factors that were
    overlooked by the proposed model due to lack of data may be
    significant. For example, the publication record and strength of
    reference letters of the applicant. These may be obtained by mining the
    comments section, and we should leave it for future work.
    For the sake of completeness,
    we should mention that imposing multilevel
    regression and postratification (MRP) \cite{Wang:2015:MRP} may ameliorate
    some of the limitations. We are, nonetheless, content with this model
    in this rather introductory and casual writing and shall, again, leave this
    for future work.
