Hi folks:

Have you come across any dataset that may be interesting to work on?

Most of the datasets I've played with (e.g., images) won't be very smooth to be analyzed using \texttt{SAS}.
I recommend we focused on \texttt{R} and the last few chapters, namely,
hidden markov chain and Bayes nets.

Best.
