\section{Bayesian Net} \label{sec:bn}

	From the previous mode, we note there is indeed underlying conditional
	independeices among the covariates of interest. In this subsectoin,
	we explore along this line using Bayesian net. Noted the quantitative vacovariates in the dataset
	are generally not very suitable for Gaussian BN (for example, the support is not the entire real line).
	To that end, we first quantize several variables of interest by thresholding. We divide \var{gpa}, \var{gre\_verbar}
	and \var{uni\_pub} into four levels \var{A, B, C, D}, which we termed as \var{gpa\_level},
	\var{gre\_level} and \var{uni\_pub\_level}. We consider the dependency
	relationship among these derived variables as well as \var{degree}, \var{status}, \var{decision},
	\var{decision\_method}.

	\subsection{Structural Inference}

		\end{figure}

		We first learn the dependency strucuture from data using \noun{Hill-Climbing} (HC) algorithm \cite{Tsa:2006:HC}.
		HC algorithm, in the hindsight, performs iterative optimization on the space of directed acyclic graphs
		by maximizing \noun{network score}. In this case, we select the score
		based on Bayesian Information Criterion (BIC), namely,
		\begin{equation} \label{eq:bn_bic}
		\begin{aligned}
			\mathrm{BIC}(G) = \ell(\x \vert G) - \frac{d}{2} \ln n,
		\end{aligned}
		\end{equation}
		where $\ell(\cdot)$ is the log-likelihood of the data conditioning on the graph
		structure, $d$ the number of parameters in the mode and $n$ the number of observations.
		We depicted the graph used in \Cref{fig:bn}. This graph is based on the one
		fitted using HC algorithm and we added one edge from \var{status} to \var{decision} for betterWe consider the Markov blanket
		for \var{decision} (light scarlet shaded region). Noted \var{decision} is $d$-separated
		from all other covariates that are not in the same blanket. In other words, the inference
		on \var{decision} may be solely performed on \var{gpa}, \var{status}, \var{degree},
		\var{decision\_method} and \var{uni\_pub}.

	\subsection{Parameter Estimation and Inference}

		We proceed to fit the Bayeseian net using the structure learnt from the previous subsection.
		We highlight several insights from interpretating the learnt conditional probability table.

		\paragraph{PhD is more competitative for non U.S. degree holders}
			We first consider the conditional probability estimates
			for \var{decision} conditioning on \var{degree} and \var{status}, as tabulated
			in \Cref{table:bn:1}. Noted the evolution of the conditaionl probability table
			as the \var{stauts} becomes less favourable (i.e., from \var{A} to \var{U} to \var{I} and to \var{O}).
			Noted we cannot interpret these probability as an implication of casuality relationship. Nonetheless,
			the dependence do reveal that U.S. universities tends be more favourable of candidates with
			U.S. bachelor's degrees. In particular, PhD are even more competitative for non U.S. degree holders
			than MS.

		\paragraph{Decision methods are similar across different tier of schools}
			We consider the the conditional probability of \var{decision}
			given different combinations of \var{decision\_method}
			and \var{uni\_pub\_level}. \Cref{table:bn:2} is conditioning
			on Tier-A schools whereas \Cref{table:bn:3} on Tier-C.
			We note, in general, E-mails are most widely usedly method
			for delivering both good and bad news. Phones are less used,
			nonetheless, an interesting observation is that if an applicant
			receives a phone call, then it is at least three times more likely
			that the incoming call is an offer than a rejection letter.

		\paragraph{Further remarks}
			As remarked before, noted the learnt graph with the condition probabilities
			do \emph{not} imply any casual relationships, and should be used only for quering
			effects of evidence as what we have analyzed. To conclude, we note the insights
			drawn from this graphical model is quite consistent with what has been experienced among
			graduate school applicants - either successful or not.
